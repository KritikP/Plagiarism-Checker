We used various files with different scenarios and types of test cases to test our program.
Some such files and scenarios contained:
- Empty files and directories and files with numbers and different kinds of character types
- Various numbers of file, analysis, and directory threads
- Various suffixes
- Very large files

We used Valgrind to check and fix errors and memory leaks.
